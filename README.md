##**Mid-term Project: Effects of Land Management Practices on Soil Respiration**  
This repository contains the code and data for common land management practices on soil respiration following precipitation events.  

#**Project Summary**  
Soil respiration plays a crucial role in the carbon cycle, and understanding how it is affected by management practices such as fertilization and tillage is essential for sustaining ecosystems. In this project, we investigated the effects of these practices on soil respiration across different days following precipitation events.

#**Goals**  
The primary goal of this project is to assess how different land management practices, including fertilization, tillage, and their combinations, affect soil respiration across various days following precipitation events. By examining these effects, we aim to gain insights into the interactions between management practices and environmental factors on soil carbon fluxes.  

#**Contents**  
Data: Contains the raw data used in the analysis.  
Code: Includes R scripts used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
